# Manga Generation Guide

Welcome to the **Manga Generator Studio**, where you can bring your stories to life using AI! This guide will walk you through the process of generating your own manga pages step-by-step.

## Step 1: Accessing the Studio

First, ensure you are logged into your account. Once authenticated, click the **"Studio"** button in the top navigation bar to enter the workspace.

In the Studio, your work is organized into **Projects** and **Sessions**. A Project can contain multiple Sessions, which are great for organizing different chapters or alternative story branches.

## Step 2: Setting up Your Story

Before generating images, you need to configure your manga's settings:

1. Click on the **Settings (Gear Icon)** in the top right (or the Settings tab on mobile).
2. **Context / Backstory**: Write a high-level summary of what your manga is about. Mention the main characters, the setting, and the primary conflict. The AI will use this context to maintain consistency across generation requests so you don't have to repeat yourself.
3. **Manga Config**: Toggle any specific aesthetic preferences you want the AI to adhere to (e.g., keeping the style strictly black and white, or focusing on high-detail environments).

## Step 3: Generating Your First Page

On the right side of the screen (or in the Settings tab on mobile), you'll find the **Prompt Panel**.

1. **Enter your Prompt**: Type a description of the scene you want to visualize. Be descriptive about character actions, emotions, and the camera angle.
   _Example: "A close-up of the hero, sweat dripping down his face, gritting his teeth as he unsheathes a massive glowing sword."_
2. **Click Generate**: Press the primary `Generate` button. Based on your current Subscription Plan, 1 generation will be deducted from your monthly limit.
3. **Wait for the Magic**: A progress bar will appear while the AI renders your manga panel. Once finished, it will appear in the center canvas.

## Step 4: Batch Generation (Auto-Continue)

If you have a Pro or Ultra plan, you can save significant time by utilizing the **Batch Generate** feature.

1. Ensure your **Context** is highly detailed.
2. In the Prompt Panel, click the dropdown arrow next to the Generate button.
3. Select how many pages you want to generate sequentially (e.g., 3, 5, or 10 pages).
4. The AI will read your story context, analyze the previous pages, and _automatically_ invent the next logical steps in the narrative, prompting and generating the artwork without requiring manual input for every single page!

## Step 5: Managing the Canvas

As pages are generated, they will populate in your **Session Sidebar** on the left.

- **Drag and Drop**: You can rearrange the order of pages directly in the sidebar.
- **Delete**: Remove any pages that didn't turn out quite right.
- **Mark for Export (Bookmark)**: Click the bookmark icon on the pages you want to include in your final PDF. Only bookmarked pages will be exported.

## Step 6: Exporting to PDF

Once you have a sequence of pages you are happy with:

1. Ensure all the pages you want are marked for export in the sidebar.
2. Click the **"Download PDF"** button in the top right header.
3. The system will compile all your selected high-resolution manga pages into a single PDF document for you to download, read, and share with your community!
